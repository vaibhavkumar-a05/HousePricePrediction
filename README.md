House Price Prediction Project
Project Overview
This project involves predicting house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques.
The project is divided into multiple stages, including data collection, data cleaning, data processing, model training, and evaluation.
Files in the Repository
house_prediction.csv: The original dataset containing features and target variable for house prices.
cleaned_dataset.csv: The cleaned dataset obtained after data processing and cleaning.
your_colab_code.ipynb: The Google Colab notebook containing the code for data cleaning, processing, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: Documentation file for the project.
Project Steps
1. Data Collection
The dataset house_prediction.csv is collected from a reliable source.
The dataset contains various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and more.
2. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicate records.
Convert categorical features to numerical using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalize or standardize numerical features as necessary.
3. Data Processing
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Perform feature selection to choose the most relevant features for the model.
Use techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction if needed.
4. Model Training
Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for house price prediction (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Train multiple models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared.
5. Model Evaluation
Compare the performance of different models.
Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
6. Prediction
Use the trained model to predict house prices on new, unseen data.
Save the predictions and the cleaned dataset for future reference.
Conclusion
The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a house price prediction model.
It covers essential steps such as data cleaning, processing, model training, and evaluation.
The final model can be used to predict house prices with a reasonable accuracy.
Future Work
Enhance the model by incorporating additional features such as neighborhood amenities, market trends, and more.
Experiment with advanced machine learning techniques and deep learning models.
Deploy the model using a web application for real-time house price predictions.
